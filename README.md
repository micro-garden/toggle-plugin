# Toggle Options Plugin for Micro

**Toggle Options** is a plugin for
the [micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/) text editor that adds two
commands for toggling boolean configuration options.

It is especially useful when bound to keyboard shortcuts, allowing quick
enable/disable of features like `wordwrap`, `hlsearch`, or `linter`.

See [help/toggle.md](help/toggle.md) for more details.

## Installation

Place the plugin folder in `~/.config/micro/plug/toggle/`, or clone it
directly from the GitHub repository:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/micro/plug
git clone https://github.com/micro-garden/toggle-plugin ~/.config/micro/plug/toggle
```

Alternatively, this plugin is also available through the unofficial plugin
channel:  
https://github.com/micro-garden/unofficial-plugin-channel  
You can install it by adding the channel and then using `plugin install`.
